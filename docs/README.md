# Universal Ctag Documentation #

For easy reading of this documentation go to http://ctags.readthedocs.org

To build the documentation local you need to have [Python Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
installed. There is a `Makefile` in the `docs` subdirectory to build
various output formats.

To help writing our documentation you need to know reStructuredText.
A good place to start is http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

A handy reStructuredText and Sphinx cheatsheet can be found at
http://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.org/cheatsheet/
