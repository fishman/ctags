* howto

  [svn] -> [local exuberant git repo] -> [exuberant branch of local fishman git repo] 

  1. prepare fishman repo: a local git repo forked from github.

     You may know how to do it.

  2. prepare exuberant repo: a local git repo clone from exuberant svn tree.

    You can make a clone repo with following command line:

    $ git svn clone http://svn.code.sf.net/p/ctags/code -T trunk

    Rename `code' to $DIR/exuberant.

    If you have exuberant repo already, do git svn fetch to get
    the latest changes.

  3. add exuberant as remote repo to config of fishman repos

     [remote "exuberant"]
	url = file:///$DIR/exuberant
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/exuberant

  4. fetch the changes

     $ git fetch exuberant

  5. cherry-pick

     5.1 Make a branch at local fishman repo and switch to it.
     5.2 Do cherry-pick like:

	 $ git cherry-pick -s -x c81a8ce

	 You can find commit id on the another terminal:

	 $ git checkout exuberant
	 $ git log
	 or
	 $ git long --oneline

	 If conflicts are occurred in cherry-picking, you can
	 abort/reset cherry-picking with:

	 $ git reset --hard

	 at the branch for picking.
